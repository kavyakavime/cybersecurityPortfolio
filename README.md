My Google cybersecurity professional certificate portfolio

## Professional Statement

I am passionate about cybersecurity, especially applying best security practices in cloud computing. With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, I am invested in how we can protect these dynamic systems from constantly evolving threats.

This portfolio reflects my hands-on journey through various cybersecurity labs and real-world scenarios. You will find my work on vulnerability assessments, practical Linux commands, and incident report analysis. I have also developed Python algorithms and crafted SQL queries to support data investigation.

My incident handler’s journal depicts how I approach security incidents step-by-step, using frameworks like the Pyramid of Pain to understand attacker behaviors. Additionally, I have explored network analysis and packet inspection using tools like tcpdump and Wireshark, which help me dissect traffic and spot anomalies in detail.

I believe that my portfolio doesn’t just reflect my skills, but also my commitment to continuously learning and applying cloud security practices in tangible, impactful ways.
