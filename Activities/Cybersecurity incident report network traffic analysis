# Cybersecurity Incident Report:
## Network Traffic Analysis
###Part 1: Provide a summary of the problem found in the DNS and ICMP 
traffic log.
The UDP protocol reveals that the request to retrieve the IP address for “yummyrecipesforme.com” did not go through. After the request is sent we receive a ICMP (Internet control message protocol) message which is a protocol for communicating network errors. If we receive a message with this protocol, then we should be aware that something went wrong with our request. We can identify where things went wrong by closely examining the response we get. Based on the result of the tcpdump, we get an ICMP error message of udp port 53 unreachable of length 150.” The port noted in the error message is port 53 and this port is used for Domain name system(DNS) communication. Examining the error message, we also see that the issue is with the DNS. It says that “ port 53 unreachable”, which is mostly likely due to the fact that there is a problem in the DNS server. The problem associated with the DNS server has caused none of the user requests to go through and get the webpage.
